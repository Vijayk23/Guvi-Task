    The Difference Between the Two Protocols HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2.0
  </p>
  <h3 style="font:bold; font-family: sans-serif; color:rgb(65, 65, 65)">
    Development Of HTTP1.1
  </h3>
  <p style="font-family: sans-serif; color:rgb(27, 27, 27);line-height: 200%;">
    HTTP1.1, the first standardized version of HTTP, was introduced in 1997. It presented significant performance optimizations (over HTTP/0.9 and HTTP/1.0) and transformed the way requests and responses were exchanged between clients and servers.

  <h3 style="font:bold; font-family: sans-serif; color:rgb(65, 65, 65)">
    Key Features of HTTP1.1:
  </h3>
  <ul style="font-family: sans-serif; color:rgb(27, 27, 27); line-height: 200%;">
    <li>The Upgrade header was used to indicate a preference from the client that made it possible to switch to a more preferred protocol if found appropriate by the server.</li>
    <li>It allowed a single request/response for every TCP connection.</li>
    <li>Status codes were used to indicate successful requests and to indicate transmission errors.</li>
    <li>It was no longer required for each connection to be terminated immediately after every request was served with a response; instead, with the keep-alive header, it was possible to have persistent connections.</li>
  </ul>
    <h3 style="font:bold; font-family: sans-serif; color:rgb(65, 65, 65)">
        Evolution Of HTTP2
      </h3>
      <p style="font-family: sans-serif; color:rgb(27, 27, 27);line-height: 200%;">
        At the beginning of 2010, Google introduced an experimental protocol,which supported multiplexing (multiple requests/responses sent and received asynchronously over a single TCP connection) 
      </p>
      <img src="http2.jpg" alt="HTTP2.0" width="480px" height="280px" postion="center" >
<h3 style="font:bold; font-family: sans-serif; color:rgb(65, 65, 65)">
        Key Features of HTTP2.0:
      </h3>
      <ul style="font-family: sans-serif; color:rgb(27, 27, 27); line-height: 200%;">
        <li>Introduces the concept of multiplexing that interleaves the requests and responses without head-of-line blocking and does so over a single TCP connection.</li>
        <li>HTTP2.0 uses HPACK header compression algorithm that is resilient to attacks like CRIME and utilizes static Huffman encoding.</li>
        <li>It introduces the concept of a server push where the server anticipates the resources that will be required by the client and pushes them prior to the client making requests. The client retains the authority to deny the server push; however, in most cases, this feature adds a lot of efficiency to the process.</li>
